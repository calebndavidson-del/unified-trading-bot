# Unified Trading Strategy Documentation

## Overview

The Unified Trading Strategy is a comprehensive trading approach that combines all available trading strategies and market data sources using advanced ensemble methods and feature selection techniques. This implementation addresses overfitting concerns while integrating technical analysis, earnings data, sentiment analysis, and other market indicators into a single robust decision-making framework.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Feature Selector** (`features/feature_selector.py`)
   - Advanced feature selection using multiple methods (Lasso, Elastic Net, RFE, Mutual Information)
   - Noise reduction techniques for different feature types
   - Correlation-based feature filtering
   - Composite feature creation

2. **Ensemble Model** (`features/ensemble_model.py`)
   - Multiple base models: Ridge, Elastic Net, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network
   - Voting, stacking, and weighted average ensemble methods
   - Cross-validation for overfitting prevention
   - Regularization and early stopping

3. **Unified Strategy** (`features/unified_strategy.py`)
   - Integrates all existing base strategies
   - Processes multiple data sources (price, earnings, sentiment)
   - Risk management and signal processing
   - Adaptive confidence thresholds

### Base Strategies Integrated

- **Technical Analysis**: RSI, Moving Averages, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Mean Reversion**: Statistical mean reversion using Bollinger Bands
- **Momentum**: MACD-based momentum detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Candlestick pattern analysis

## Configuration

The unified strategy is configured through the `model_config.py` file with the following structure:

```python
unified_strategy_config = {
    'feature_selection': {
        'max_features': 50,
        'regularization_alpha': 0.01,
        'stability_threshold': 0.8,
        'correlation_threshold': 0.95,
        'noise_reduction_window': 5
    },
    'ensemble': {
        'ensemble_method': 'voting',  # 'voting', 'stacking', 'weighted_average'
        'regularization_strength': 0.01,
        'cv_folds': 5,
        'min_samples_for_training': 100,
        'overfitting_threshold': 0.2
    },
    'risk_management': {
        'max_signal_strength': 1.0,
        'confidence_threshold': 0.3,
        'signal_decay_rate': 0.95,
        'volatility_adjustment': True
    }
}
```

## Feature Selection Process

### 1. Data Collection and Processing
- **Price Data**: OHLCV data from multiple timeframes
- **Technical Indicators**: 40+ technical analysis features
- **Earnings Data**: EPS surprises, growth rates, guidance changes
- **Sentiment Data**: News sentiment, social media indicators
- **Market Structure**: Support/resistance levels, trend classification

### 2. Noise Reduction
Different techniques are applied based on feature type:
- **Sentiment Features**: Rolling averages and momentum calculations
- **Price Features**: Median filtering for spike removal
- **Volume Features**: Log transformation and smoothing
- **Technical Indicators**: Exponential moving average smoothing

### 3. Feature Selection Methods
Multiple selection methods are combined for robustness:
- **Lasso Regularization**: L1 penalty for sparse feature selection
- **Elastic Net**: Combined L1/L2 penalty for correlated features
- **Recursive Feature Elimination**: Tree-based importance ranking
- **Mutual Information**: Non-linear relationship detection

### 4. Composite Feature Creation
Advanced features combining multiple signals:
- **Technical Composite**: Normalized combination of technical indicators
- **Trend Composite**: Multi-timeframe trend strength
- **Volatility Composite**: Market volatility indicators
- **Sentiment Composite**: Aggregated sentiment signals

## Ensemble Methods

### Voting Ensemble (Default)
- Combines predictions from multiple base models
- Weights based on cross-validation performance
- Robust to individual model failures

### Stacking Ensemble
- Uses meta-learner to combine base model predictions
- Out-of-fold predictions prevent overfitting
- Ridge regression as meta-learner for stability

### Weighted Average
- Simple weighted combination based on validation performance
- Fallback method for stability

## Overfitting Prevention

### 1. Regularization
- L1/L2 regularization in linear models
- Dropout and early stopping in neural networks
- Tree depth limits in ensemble models

### 2. Cross-Validation
- Time series cross-validation for temporal data
- Out-of-fold predictions for stacking
- Performance monitoring across folds

### 3. Feature Constraints
- Maximum feature limits
- Correlation thresholds
- Stability requirements

### 4. Signal Processing
- Confidence thresholds
- Signal decay for consecutive signals
- Volatility-based adjustments

## Risk Management

### Signal Processing
- **Confidence Filtering**: Only signals above threshold are used
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Reduced signals during high volatility
- **Signal Decay**: Consecutive signals have reduced strength
- **Position Sizing**: Risk-adjusted position calculation

### Performance Monitoring
- **Overfitting Score**: Monitors cross-validation consistency
- **Directional Accuracy**: Tracks prediction direction success
- **Information Ratio**: Risk-adjusted performance metric
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Downside risk measurement

## Usage Examples

```python
from features.unified_strategy import UnifiedTradingStrategy

# Create strategy with default configuration
